I got a bullet journal for my birthday the summer of 2023. I did some journaling, some scribbling, some forgetting about it. For a while, used it when I played cards with my wife to keep track of the score.

Journaling seems like a good habit, and I might try and pick it up again. But I haven't felt the ROI enough yet for it to stick. I did, however, start using my journal for a *revolutionary* new habit this year: Writing to-do lists.

## Digital productivity tools
I have used Notion, Workflowy, Asana, Google Keep, and Apple Notes. I still use Google Keep for the odd note or grocery list every now and then. But for me, digital productivity tools just don't do it. Trying to reduce digital distractions by using a digital productivity tool is silly.

Using digital tools, the process of looking at or checking off a task can look like this:

1. Pull out or pick up phone
2. Unlock phone
3. Ignore distracting notifications, shiny and colorful app icons, and interactive widgets
4. Open the tasks app if it's not open
5. Find the task and read / check it off

Optional follow-up step:

6. Resist temptation to "just check something" and put the phone down.

## Paper and pen

Using a hand written, paper to-do list positioned next to my laptop, the process is simpler:

1. Look at task
2. If task is completed: pick up pen and check it off

Throughout my work day I can glance at my list and notice the progress I am making. Seeing the checked boxes accumulate feeds the motivation machine and keeps me focused on finishing the current task and looking forward to the next one.

## Habit hacks
To avoid making "write to-do list" my first task of the day, when motivation can be a bit variable, I try to write as many tasks as I can at the end of the day. That way I don't have to think as much early in the morning, I can just look at the list and start.

I try to write enough tasks that I would be happy if I got them all done in a full day of work. If I happen to finish them all by lunch, great! I can then continue working at a leisurely pace and make sure to take time for breaks to stretch my legs and walk my dog, without feeling like I'm ditching work.

I also include personal tasks in the list, like cleaning the kitchen, taking out the recycling, and making sure my dog gets four walks (he is a couch potato and will only signal a desire to go out if he is literally about to shit his pants). This way I have a number of simpler tasks that I can take care of quickly and get the checked-boxes-motivation-juice flowing. They also provide me with a short break from work which can really help when I'm feeling stuck. I have solved several issues while taking out the trash.
