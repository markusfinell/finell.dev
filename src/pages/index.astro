        <p>
          I am a web developer at
          <a href="https://www.storyhouseegmont.se/">Story House Egmont</a>
          in Stockholm, Sweden.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been working in web development for almost a decade. My goal is
          to build accessible, fast, and beautiful experiences for the web. Most
          of my work has been with/for/around WordPress, but I love the
          flexibility and control of building static, headless sites with Astro,
          regardless of CMS.
        </p>

          Outside of work I enjoy
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LH6-w57Slw"
            >growing vegetables</a
          >
          in the garden, running
          <a href="https://strava.com/athletes/markusfinell">ultramarathons</a>,
          spooning my dog, eating vegan food, and reading anything my wife
          recommends.
